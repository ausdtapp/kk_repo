# kk_repo
Repository for a Secret Santa program.

This is a program that takes a GoogleSheet with rows of family members with a column for name and a column for email 
(each family is seperated by an empty row), and matches them to a different person from a different person from a 
different family. It creates one large continuous loop of people for a Secret Santa event Where each person acts out
their match.
